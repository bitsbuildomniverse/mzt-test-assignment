# MyZenTeam code test assignment

## Description

In this test assignment we have prepared a hiring platform where job seekers (candidates) can be found and get contacted from companies' hiring managers.

The platform is free for job seekers, but not for companies.
The billing is handled by using a wallet. At the start each company has a wallet with 20 coins of credit.
These coins can be used to contact candidates and contacting a candidate will cost the company 5 coins.

On the candidates' list there is a button `Contact` and this is where a company can contact a candidate.
One of the tasks for this test assignment is to implement the `Contact a candidate` feature which should consist of the following:
when a company contacts a candidate, we should send an email to that candidate and charge the company 5 coins from its wallet.

Aside from the feature, we're aware that this app is far from perfect, so we'd like you to fix/improve anything that you find to be wrong or needs improvement (code, architecture, naming, readability, robustness, etc.).

While doing this test assignment, please pay attention to these aspects:

- Security - we do not want to be hacked
- Best practices - code should be clean and easy to maintain
- Documentation - provide information on how to set up the project
- Tests - test the parts that you feel necessary to
- Logic - we should not allow overspending the balance of the wallet

## Notes
- Authentication **IS NOT** in the scope of this assignment.
- The list of candidates, the company and the wallet are predefined and there is no need to create new ones.
- Always consider that the only existing company in the database is the one that contacts the job seekers (candidates)
